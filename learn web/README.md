The Fake News Detector is a machine learning project that identifies false information across digital media sources. 
It draws its assessment of the likelihood of a piece of content being misleading or fabricated based on patterns in the language, sentiment, and the metadata in articles and posts. 
The Fake News Detector is a class that makes use of the union of NLP techniques and supervised learning models to classify news articles as authentic or not; this, in turn, 
flags unreliable content for users and platforms. Other features include pre-processing data to cleanse and tokenize text, feature extraction techniques using TF-IDF and word
embedding, and training of a model with labeled datasets annotated with labels like "fake" and "real."

The project can be attached to web applications or social media monitoring tools and can provide a back-end API that evaluates text in real-time. 
This is very useful for media firms, social platforms, and individuals in the fight against misinformation and promotion of credibility in online spaces.# Fake-News-Detector
